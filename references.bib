  abstract = {Background: Racialized populations disproportionately experience exposures that impair lung function. Race-neutral reference equations mitigate bias due to disparities at the cost of reduced precision. However, it is unclear what proportion of racial gaps in lung function is due to known disparities. Hypothesis: Measurable disparities will help explain racial gaps in lung function. Methods: ‚ÄØWe defined reference populations from 20,050 Black and White NHANES 2007-2012 participants. Starting with non-smokers without respiratory symptoms or diagnoses, we sequentially excluded those with occupational exposure to dust/fumes, maternal tobacco use, second-hand smoke exposure, obesity, low physical activity, unhealthy diet, self-assessed poor health, and no insurance. Across populations, we compared average age-, sex-, and height-adjusted differences in FEV1 and FVC between Black and White adults (‚â•20) and youth (&lt;20). Results: From the base reference population to the most restrictive, the percentage of Black participants decreased from 20% to 16% in youth and 14% to 7% in adults. The racial gap in lung function was reduced from 0.40 L (95%CI 0.36-0.43) to 0.31 L (95%CI 0.26-0.36) in FEV1 and from 0.48 L (95%CI 0.44-0.51) to 0.36 (95%CI 0.30-0.42) in FVC in youth but increased in adults. Conclusions: The disparities investigated herein explain up to 25% of the racial gap in lung function among American youth. Further research on adults is required. erj;64/suppl_68/OA5572/F1F1F1},

    abstract = { The World Health Organization (WHO) Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS) is a community-based, multicountry project to develop new growth references for infants and young children. The design combines a longitudinal study from birth to 24 months with a cross-sectional study of children aged 18 to 71 months. The pooled sample from the six participating countries (Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, and the United States) consists of about 8,500 children. The study subpopulations had socioeconomic conditions favorable to growth, and low mobility, with at least 20\% of mothers following feeding recommendations and having access to breastfeeding support. The individual inclusion criteria were absence of health or environmental constraints on growth, adherence to MGRS feeding recommendations, absence of maternal smoking, single term birth, and absence of significant morbidity. In the longitudinal study, mothers and newborns were screened and enrolled at birth and visited at home 21 times: at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6; monthly from 2 to 12 months; and every 2 months in their second year. In addition to the data collected on anthropometry and motor development, information was gathered on socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental characteristics, perinatal factors, morbidity, and feeding practices. The prescriptive approach taken is expected to provide a single international reference that represents the best description of physiological growth for all children under five years of age and to establish the breastfed infant as the normative model for growth and development. }
