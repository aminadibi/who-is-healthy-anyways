## Race and Body Proportions

Is there a relationship between body proportions and race in NHANES III? Let's take a look.

## Sitting Height

```{r}
rm(list = ls(all.names = TRUE))
library(tidyverse)
nhanes3 <- readRDS("nhanesIII.rds")

summary(nhanes3$height, na.rm = TRUE)
summary(nhanes3$sitting_height, na.rm = TRUE)

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}

nhanes3 <- nhanes3 %>% mutate(cormic = sitting_height/height) 

nhanes3 %>% 
  group_by(race_text_nhanes) %>%
  summarise(cormic=weighted.mean(sitting_height/height, w = WTPFEX6, na.rm=TRUE))
  
```

There seems to be some difference. Can we predict sitting height? With race, you likely can. Without race, it might not be useful. But worth trying.

```{r}
 lm_fit <- lm(formula_text, data=df, weights=MEC6YR)
  res <- (tidy(lm_fit, conf.int=TRUE) %>% filter(str_detect(term, "race")))

```
